#+title: Nezz: discovery

* 2023-07-19
** What if Nezz was a drop-in replacement for neil?
- =nezz dep add= to add deps - with a fuzzy fallback.
- =nezz dep scan= to scan for deps.
- =nezz dep change-alias= to move a dep from toplevel to an alias

When nezz is called with args to =dep add=, it could fall back to raw neil commands.
Why?

Or:


- =nezz dep add= to add deps - with a fuzzy fallback.
- =nezz dep change-alias= to move a dep from toplevel to an alias
- =nezz index scan= to scan for deps.
- =nezz index list= to scan for deps.
